git commit

# Get latest changes (do we want --all option?)
git pull

# Checkout "submission" branch to working directory
git checkout submission

# Merge from "master" to "submission"
git merge master

# Check things are okay
git status

# Commit merge changes from working directory to submission branch
git commit

# Push all changes upstream
